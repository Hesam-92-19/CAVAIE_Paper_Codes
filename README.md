# CAVAIE_Paper_Codes

These Jupyter notebooks and accompanying files are for the publication "Towards a general unsupervised novelty detection framework in structural health monitoring."
https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/mice.12812

All codes are written on Google Collaboratory. Colab environment must be used to avoid possible errors.

First, Data_Networks_Training_Tuning.ipynb notebook must be executed, and then the other. Further descriptions are available in the files.

Please let me know of any difficulties compiling these files on Google Colab. 

Thank you.
